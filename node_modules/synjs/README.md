# SynJS #

SynJS allows to write and execute javascript code in synchronous manner, so you don't have to fight callback hell with promise hell.

## What is it ##

<p>
SynJS is a parser and executor of Javascript code, that is written in Javascript.
It parses Javascript code, extract individual Javascript operators, wraps them into functions, places them into internal tree-like structure, and then executes them synchronously.
</p>

With SynJS you can write code like this:
 
    var res, i=0;
    
    while(i<5) {
    
        setTimeout(function() {
            res = 'i='+i;
            SynJS.resume(_synjsContext);
        },1000);
        
        SynJS.wait();
        
        console.log(res, new Date());
        
        i++;
    }
    
It introduces following 2 statements:

- **SynJS.wait()**: this operator is used in main logic flow to pause execution of the flow
- **SynJS.resume(_synjsContext)**: this function is used in callback in order to continue execution from the next statement after **SynJS.wait()**
 
When executed, the code above will show following in your console:

    i=0 Wed Dec 21 2016 11:45:33 GMT-0700 (Mountain Standard Time)
    i=1 Wed Dec 21 2016 11:45:34 GMT-0700 (Mountain Standard Time)
    i=2 Wed Dec 21 2016 11:45:35 GMT-0700 (Mountain Standard Time)
    i=3 Wed Dec 21 2016 11:45:36 GMT-0700 (Mountain Standard Time)
    i=4 Wed Dec 21 2016 11:45:37 GMT-0700 (Mountain Standard Time)
 
## Quick Start ##

In Node.JS:

    npm install synjs

    global.SynJS = global.SynJS || require('synjs');
    
In Browser:
    
    <script src="SynJS.js"></script>
    
Put your synchronous code into function:

    function myTestFunction1(paramA,paramB) {
        var res, i = 0;
        while (i < 5) {
            setTimeout(function () {
                res = 'i=' + i;
                SynJS.resume(_synjsContext);
            }, 1000);
    
            SynJS.wait();
    
            console.log(res, new Date());
            i++;
        }
        return "myTestFunction1 finished";
    }

Make sure you use **SynJS.wait()** for synchronizing your main flow with callback flow, and also make sure your callback calls **SynJS.resume(_synjsContext)** at the end.

Execute your function via SynJS:

    SynJS.run(myTestFunction1,null, function (ret) {
        console.log('done all:', ret);
    });

The result will look like this:

<pre>
i=0 Sun Dec 25 2016 12:25:41 GMT-0700 (Mountain Standard Time)
i=1 Sun Dec 25 2016 12:25:42 GMT-0700 (Mountain Standard Time)
i=2 Sun Dec 25 2016 12:25:43 GMT-0700 (Mountain Standard Time)
i=3 Sun Dec 25 2016 12:25:44 GMT-0700 (Mountain Standard Time)
i=4 Sun Dec 25 2016 12:25:45 GMT-0700 (Mountain Standard Time)
done all: myTestFunction1 finished
</pre>

## SynJS Reference ##

**SynJS.run(myTestFunction1,obj, param1, param2 [, param3 etc], callback)** _(function, to be called to execute function synchronously)_

Parameters:
- myTestFunction1: pointer to a function that needs to be executed synchronously
- obj: some object that will be accessed via "this" in myTestFunction1 (could be null)
- param1, param2, etc - any number of parameters
- callback: some function to call once myTestFunction1 is finished.

Returns:
- execution context

**SynJS.wait()** _(operator, to be called from main flow)_
Waits until **SynJS.resume()** is called, and then continues with the next statement.

**SynJS.wait(numeric_expr)** _(operator, to be called from main flow)_
- numeric_expr: number of milliseconds
Waits numeric_expr milliseconds, and then continues with the next statement.

**SynJS.wait(non_numeric_expr)** _(operator, to be called from main flow)_
- non_numeric_expr: condition
Waits until **SynJS.resume()** is called, checks if non_numeric_expr evaluates to true, then continues with the next statement. Otherwise continues waiting.

**SynJS.resume(context)** _(function, to be called from callback)_
- context: execution context, that needs to be resumed. Execution context can be accessed inside myTestFunction1 via _synjsContext variable.

SynJS supports following types of operators:
- var
- if ... else
- while
- do ... while
- for(;;)
- for(var ;;)
- for(.. in ..)
- for(var .. in ..)
- switch
- break [label]
- continue [label]
- return

Following operators are not yet supported:
- const
- let
- for ... of
- try ... catch

### Bonus ###
**SynJS.goto(expr)** - evaluates expr into label name and jumps to that label. Label is searched within the scope of current code block and all parent blocks. 

## How it works ##

SynJS accepts function pointer as an input parameter, and performs following:

- It parses code of input function, and builds a few internal structures, such as:
    - an internal tree structure of operators, that represents code of input function
    - hash array with local variables names, that were defined in input function using _var_ statement
- It "compiles" each operator by 
    - modifying source of operator by changing references to local variables
    - creating internal function that contain modified statement code
- It creates execution context that contains local variables, execution stack with program counters, and other information, that is necessary in order to store the latest state, and to resume execution. 
- It executes structure of operators (code) against execution context (data).


### Step 1: Parsing ###

In the example above SynJS parses code and recognizes 3 statements:

Statement 1:

    var res, i=0;

Statement 2:

    while(i<5) {
        ...
    }

Statement 3:

    return "myTestFunction1 finished";

Statement 2 starts with _while_ keyword, so SynJS parses condition and body of the cycle:

Condition:

    i<5
    
Body contains few statements itself, so SynJS parses it recursively:

Body Statement 2.1:

        setTimeout(function() {
            res = 'i='+i;
            SynJS.resume(_synjsContext);
        },1000);

Body Statement 2.2:

        SynJS.wait();

Body Statement 2.3:

        console.log(res, new Date());

Body Statement 2.4:

        i++;

### Step 2. Compiling ###

Once statement cannot be decomposed any further, SynJS "compiles" it by doing 2 things:
- modifying code of statement and replacing all references to local vars
- wrapping statement code into internal function:    

    function(_synjsContext) {
        code_of_the_statement
    }
    
Hash of local variables is created by parsing all **var** statements. In our example it would contain 2 names:
- res
- i
    
This array is used in order to replace all references to local vars with reference to local var hash in _synjsContext. Statement 2.3 above is converted and compiled into following internal function:
 
    function(_synjsContext) {
        setTimeout(function() {
             _synjsContext.localVars.res = 'i='+_synjsContext.localVars.i;
             SynJS.resume(_synjsContext);
        },1000);
    }

### Step 3. Executing ###

<p>
When SynJS.run() is first called, it checks if parameter function is already compiled. If necessary, tree structure that represents code of the function is built and added as <i>_synjsBin</i> property to a function object.
Then the execution context is created, and placed into global hash of all running contexts. Once SynJS.run is done, corresponding execution context is deleted.
